**openapi-processor**
is a small framework that converts an link:{openapi}[OpenAPI] YAML (or JSON) descriptions to a target format. The primary target is Java code. It generates interfaces and DTOs (pojos or records) based on the API, and you implement the interfaces in your controllers.

The target programming language is Java, which makes the generated code usable from most JVM languages.

**starting with an API** +
openapi-processor is useful if you explicitly define and document your service API using OpenAPI with the interface to the outside and its usage in mind before you implement it. You do not derive the API later from the implementation and its implicit design. Of course, this is not a one time step but an iterative process.

The *disadvantages* are:

* you have to learn OpenAPI & write the OpenAPI description.
* the code generation has its limits and does not support all use cases.

The *advantages* are:

* you have a single place to maintain the api which makes it easier to create a consistent api and keep the overview.
* you don't need to manually write the controller annotations and remember all the annotation details.
* you can skip generation of endpoints that have special (unsupported) requirements and write them manually.
* it is easy to document in plain text. You can use Markdown in the OpenAPI `description` properties.
* it helps to keep the implementation in sync with the OpenAPI description. If anything relevant changes in the API the interface changes and the compiler will warn that the interface is not implemented correctly.

**code generation** +
A processor generates java interfaces based on the endpoint descriptions of the API and simple Pojo or Record classes for parameter or response schemas defined in the API with the help of the type mapping configuration. The processor adds all the required annotations to the interface, and all that is left to *you* is the implementation of the generated interfaces in any way you like.

**.. a few things it can do**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; flex-wrap: wrap;">

[.card]
====
it generates **java interfaces and java dtos (pojo/record) classes** for all defined endpoints and schemas to allow full control of the endpoint implementation.

[source,java,title=endpoint interface]
----
package io.openapiprocessor.openapi.api;

import io.openapiprocessor.openapi.support.Generated;
import io.openapiprocessor.samples.MappedBar;
import jakarta.validation.Valid;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;

@Generated(value = "openapi-processor-spring", version = "2024.1")
public interface BarApi {

    /**
     * echo a Bar.
     * simple sample endpoint
     *
     * @return bar
     */
    @PostMapping(path = "/bar", consumes = {"application/json"}, produces = {"application/json"})
    MappedBar postBar(@RequestBody(required = false) @Valid MappedBar body);

}
----

====

[.card]
====
it has a **powerful type mapping configuration** (with generic support) to map schemas defined in the OpenAPI description to existing java types. Mappings can be defined globally, for a specific response, parameter or endpoint or http method (of an endpoint).

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title=global type mapping]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}
options:
  # ...

map:
  types: # list of global mappings
    - type: array => java.util.Collection
    - type: string:date-time => java.time.Instant
----

====

[.card]
====
it offers **annotation mapping** to add additional annotations to the dtos generated from the OpenAPI schemas.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title=global annotation mapping]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}
options:
  # ...

map:
  types:
    # add an annotation to the OpenAPI schema Foo
    # (the annotation may have parameters)
    - type: Foo @ annotation.Bar()
----
====

[.card]
====
it can map OpenAPI `x-` tensions to add additional annotations to schema properties.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title=global x-tension mapping]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}
options:
  # ...

map:
  extensions:
    # map x-tension values to annotations
    x-foo: single @ io.oap.FooA(value = "any")
    x-bar:
      - listA @ io.oap.FooB
      - listB @ io.oap.FooC
----
====

[.card]
====
it can add **additional parameters** to an endpoint which are not defined in the OpenAPI description. For example to pass an `HttpServletRequest` to the endpoint implementation which is nothing you want to describe in the API.
====

[.card]
====
it generates **human-readable code**.
====

[.card]
====
it supports **bean validations**. The constraints of the OpenAPI description map to java bean validation annotations.
====

[.card]
====
it supports **json merge patch** apis by generating pojos with jackson-databind-nullable where requested.
====

[.card]
====
it allows to **exclude endpoints** from generation. This is useful if the processor does not create the correct code for an endpoint. That way the processor can still be used for all the other endpoints.
====

[.card]
====
it handles **multiple responses** by generating one endpoint method for each response content type.
====

[.card]
====
it handles **relative `$ref` 's** between multiple yaml files.
