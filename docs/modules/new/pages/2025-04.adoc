* openapi-processor-spring/micronaut 2025.2

=== support endpoint with different responses for different status codes

For the example below, versions before 2025.2 would pick Bar (the last response) as the return type for the `getFooApplicationJson()` endpoint method. This doesn't work because the method must be able to return `Foo` or `Bar`.

To make this work it will now use `Object` as return type.

===  marker interface for responses

The previous fix handles multiple response objects by using `Object` as the result type. An `Object` return type is not very descriptive. It is impossible to know from the interface which results are possible.

To improve on that situation, the processor can generate a marker interface that is more descriptive and helps with navigation in the IDE.

Generation of the marker interface is enabled by adding the `response-interface` option:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v12

options:
  package-name: ...
  # ...
  response-interface: true
----

The marker interface is an empty interface, and its name is derived from the http method, path and content type to create a unique name.

If the response type (e.g., Foo from the above example OpenAPI) is used on multiple endpoints with multiple success response statuses, it will implement multiple marker interfaces.

[source,java]
----
package generated.model;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
import generated.support.Generated;

@Generated(value = "openapi-processor-core", version = "test")
public class Foo implements GetFooApplicationJsonResponse /* , .. more interfaces if Foo is used on multiple endpoints */ {

    @JsonProperty("foo")
    private String foo;

    // ...
}
----

That way it is possible to find the possible result type by navigating to the implementations of the marker interface.

=== drop OpenAPI parameter

It is now possible to drop a parameter given in the OpenAPI description from the generated code. This may be useful if a parameter is, for example, handled by a request filter and therefore is not needed in the endpoint method anymore.

To drop a parameter add a `parameters/drop` entry with the name of the parameter to drop it:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v12

options:
  package-name: generated

map:
  paths:
    /foo:
      parameters:
        - drop: foo
----

Even if it is possible to add it at the global level, it is best used at the endpoint level.

=== result-style

the `result-style` option is now handled on all levels (global, endpoint, http method) and not just on the global level.


=== formatter selection

the processor didn't use the new formatter selection, it does now properly handle `google` & `eclipse` (no need to for extra jdk configuration) values.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v12
options:
  package-name: # ...
  format-code: false      # disable code formatter
  format-code: true       # use default google code formatter
  format-code: google     # use google code formatter, i.e. the same as "true"
  format-code: eclipse    # use eclipse code formatter
