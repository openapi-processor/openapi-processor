=== setting the new compatibility options did not work

fixed setting the new compatibility options, it was always using the default values.

=== remove extra line feed in javadoc

removed the extra line feed (an empty line) in javadoc comments between summary and description.

=== optionally clear output directory

its is now possible to disable clearing of the `targetDir` when the processor is writing the generated files.
