= What's Next

This just lists a few things that *may* happen in the future in no particular order. I'm working on this as times permits... &#x1f600;

== json schema validator

May 24

- internal refactoring to separate validator code by draft version
- native compilation

== internal OpenAPI parser

May 24

- native compilation

== processor-angular

May 24

- generate typescript DTOs
- generate angular client

== annotation processor

December 22

**dropped**

unfortunately openapi-processor can't run as annotation processor. The problem is simply to detect when processing is necessary.
