=== annotation mapping by OpenAPI extensions

it is now possible to use OpenAPI `x-`tensions to add additional annotations to schema properties:

Here is a simple schema that has `x-`tensions on the `bar` property.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.1.0
# ...
components:
  schemas:
    Foo:
      type: object
      properties:
        bar:
          type: string
          x-foo: single
          x-bar:
            - listA
            - listB
----

we can now map the `x-`tensions/values to annotations like this:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6
map:
  extensions:
    x-foo: single @ io.oap.FooA(value = "any")
    x-bar:
      - listA @ io.oap.FooB
      - listB @ io.oap.FooC
----

.. which will generate the additional annotations on the property:

[source,java]
----
package generated.model;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
import generated.support.Generated;
import io.oap.FooA;
import io.oap.FooB;
import io.oap.FooC;

@Generated(value = "openapi-processor-core", version = "test")
public class Foo {

    @FooA(value = "any")
    @FooB
    @FooC
    @JsonProperty("bar")
    private String bar;

    public String getBar() {
        return bar;
    }

    public void setBar(String bar) {
        this.bar = bar;
    }

}
----


=== annotation mapping by parameter name

another small improvement to annotation mapping is that we can add annotations by parameter name:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6
map:
  parameters:
    - name: foo @ annotation.Foo
----

=== reactive bean validation

the position of the `@Valid` annotation on reactive types has changed.

Until now the `@Valid` was placed on the generic type of the reactive wrapper, like this:

[source,java]
----
    @Mapping("/foo-flux")
    void postFooFlux(@Parameter Flux<@Valid Bar> body);
----

but validation did not happen with Spring. Spring needs the `@Valid` on the reactive wrapper to trigger the validation. Therefore `@Valid` is now placed by default on the reactive wrapper:

[source,java]
----
    @Mapping("/foo-flux")
    void postFooFlux(@Parameter @Valid Flux<Bar> body);
----

It should only take a bit annotation clean up on the interface implementations to adapt your code to the new `@Valid` position.

==== keeping the old behavior

To postpone the update, set the `bean-validation-valid-on-reactive` option to `false`.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6

options:
  # ...

compatibility:
  # optional, default is true
  bean-validation-valid-on-reactive: false
----

I would like to remove this option in the future. If you still need the old `@Valid` position please create an issue to help me understand why the old `@Valid` position is still useful.

=== identifier word breaks

the processor does now recognize a change from letter to number as a word break. The improves generation of camel case identifiers.

given an identifier from the OpenAPI description, the processor would generate the following names for different kinds of identifiers:

|===
|                   |  OpenAPI       | camel case    | variable  | class      | enum

| new
| foo2Bar
| foo2**B**ar
| foo2**B**ar
| Foo2**B**ar
| FOO2_BAR

| old
| foo2Bar
| foo2bar
| foo2bar
| Foo2bar
| FOO2BAR
|===

==== keeping the old behavior

To postpone the update, set the `identifier-word-break-from-digit-to-letter` option to `false`.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6

options:
  # ...

compatibility:
  # optional, default is true
  identifier-word-break-from-digit-to-letter: false
----

=== Support Mono<ResponseEntity> as result type

previous versions allowed to configure a result wrapper (e.g. Spring `ResponseEntity`) and reactive types via `single` and `multi` mapping.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6

options:
   # ...

map:
  result: org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity

  single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

Using both always wraps the reactive types with the `result` type. For example with Spring `ResponseEntity` (`result type`) and the reactor types `Mono` and `Flux` as

[source,java]
----
ResponseEntity<Mono<...>>
ResponseEntity<Flux<...>>
----

Unfortunately if you need the reactive result to modify the http response, something like this:

[source,java]
----
// does not work
public ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>> someEndpoint() {
    return someBean.getResult()
           .map(r -> ResponseEntity
                   .ok()
                   .eTag(r.eTag())
                   .body(Mono.just(r)));
}
----

it will not work because the final type of the statement is `Mono<ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>>` and not the expected `ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>`.

With this release we can fix that by setting the `result` mapping to

[source,yaml]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v6

options:
  # ...

map:
  # wrap the ResponseEntity with Mono
  result: reactor.core.publisher.Mono<org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity>

  single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

which will generate the endpoint signature as

[source,java]
----
public Mono<ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>> someEndpoint() {
   // ...
}
----

and the above code will now work.

It is recommended to configure this on the endpoint level if you just need this for a few endpoints.
