=== package-names from location

[WARNING]
it may not behave nicely if the expected configuration requirements are not met. It also works only with the **INTERNAL** OpenAPI parser (which is the default).

The package-names from location feature allows the processor to create package names based on the file location of $refâ€™erenced parts of the OpenAPI description.

This gets enabled by setting the `package-names:location` option.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: v13

options:
  # package-name: io.openapiprocessor.sample # <1>

  package-names:
    base: io.openapiprocessor.openapi # <2>
    # this enables package generation from the endpoint $ref file location
    location:  io.openapiprocessor.samples # <3>
----

<1> the shortcut for setting `package-names.base`. If location based packages should be used, setting `package-names.base` is preferred.

<2> this is the base package for all generated code. This is identical to the current behaviour (i.e. `package-name`). Any file the is not below `package-names.location` will be generated with this as the base package.

<3> `package-name.location` is the *parent* package name of the project's *target* packages. If the processor finds a file ref'erenced from the main OpenAPI in a subpackage of `package-name.location` the generated sources will be generated with that package.

Here is an example layout to show what this is about.

The OpenAPI description of the endpoint `foo` is placed into the `package` where it will be implemented. The generated interface and resources get the package `io.openapiprocessor.samples.foo`.

The example shows only the controller implementation, but it could also contain service and repositories used to handle the `foo` endpoint. That way, *everything* related to that endpoint is in one place.

The main OpenAPI file will look something like this:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# openapi.yaml
openapi: {var-openapi-version}
info:
  title: openapi-processor sample api
  version: 1.0.0

servers:
  - url: "https://openapiprocessor.io/\{path}"
    variables:
      path:
        default: api

paths:
  /foo:
    $ref: '../main/kotlin/io/openapiprocessor/samples/foo/foo.yaml' # <1>
----

<1> `foo.yaml` (the path item of `foo`) is $ref`erenced from the main OpenAPI description.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# io/openapiprocessor/samples/foo/foo.yaml
post:
  tags:
    - foo
  summary: echo a Foo.
  description: simple sample endpoint
  requestBody:
    $ref: 'resources.yaml#/FooBody'
  responses:
    '200':
      description: foo
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: 'resources.yaml#/Foo' # <1>
----

<1> and $references the `resource.yaml` in the same folder that describes the payload resource.

The package name of the foo endpoint files is `io.openapiprocessor.samples.foo` and the nearest **parent** package is `io.openapiprocessor.samples`. This is then the `package-name` option value.

It is possible to use `io.openapiprocessor` or even `io` as the parent package.

The generated files will still go to the output folder of the used build tool. No change there apart from the package names.

See also the link:{sample}[spring-mvc-boot-4-packages-kt] for an example setup.

=== generate response status annotation

the processor does now automatically generate a response status annotation for success responses (i.e., 2xx) not equal to 200.

[WARNING]
====
This will conflict with manually added response status annotations.

To keep the old behavior, i.e., no automatically added annotations, set `result-status: false` on the global mapping level.
====

It is configured by adding it to the mapping section of the configuration file. It is available on all levels, i.e., global, endpoint and endpoint method.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}

options:
    # ...

map:
  # result-status: true is the default
  # setting it to false on the global level disables it
  result-status: false

  paths:
    # enable it for a specific endpoint
    /foo:
      result-status: true

      # ... or for a specific method of an endpoint
      #get:
      #  result-status: true
----

example:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
openapi: {var-openapi-version}
info:
  title: sample api
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /nop:
    get:
      tags:
        - nop
      summary: response status
      description: adds status for success other than 200
      responses:
        '204':
          description: no content
----

generates (with the framework-specific annotations):

[source,java]
----
package generated.api;

import annotation.Mapping;
import annotation.Status;
import generated.support.Generated;

@Generated(value = "openapi-processor-core",  version = "test")
public interface NopApi {

  /** response status adds status for success other than 200 */
  @Status(204)
  @Mapping("/nop")
  void getNop();

}
