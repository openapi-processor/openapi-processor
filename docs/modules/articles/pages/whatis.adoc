==  what is openapi-processor?

{oap}[openapi-processor] is a small framework to process OpenAPI yaml files. Currently, openapi-processor provides java code generation for Spring Boot & Micronaut.

It does support gradle and maven with plugins to convert OpenAPI yaml files to java (controller) interfaces & (payload) pojo classes as part of the build process.

It generates Java because the controller interface and pojo classes are easily usable from other jvm languages. Usually you will just use them without looking at the generated code.
