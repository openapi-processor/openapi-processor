// == what is openapi-processor?
//
// {oap}[openapi-processor] is an *easy-to-use* tool to generate java based (annotated) controller *interfaces* and *pojos/records* (model/dto classes) from an OpenAPI yaml description. It supports *Spring Boot*, *Micronaut* with *maven* or *gradle*.
//
// == type mapping

When generating interfaces and schema classes (dtos) from an OpenAPI, wouldn't it be nice to use java `record` s instead of plain pojos?

This would result in less code, immutable fields and a couple of auto-generated methods: getters, setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()` and `toString()`.

xref:new:2023-07.adoc[openapi-processor-spring/micronaut release 2023.3] is able to generate records instead of pojos from OpenAPI schemas.

This is possible because openapi-processor doesn't generate inheritance hierarchies. This would be a problem with records because records do not support the `extends` keyword.

openapi-processor does support `allOf` by merging all item properties into a single object, and it can add a marker interface to `oneOf` items to use a named type in the api interfaces instead of `Object`.

Both ways work with records!

== a little bit of OpenAPI

Here is a simple OpenAPI snippet that defines a schema:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  schemas:
    Foo:
      type: object
      properties:
        foo:
          type: string
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
----

== OpenAPI as pojo

with its default settings openapi-processor will generate a pojo dto class with some getter/setter noise.

.`Foo.java` pojo dto
[source,java]
----
include::example$record-mapping/Foo-pojo.java[]
----

It is probably not a big issue because you won't look at it very often. :-)

== a small piece of configuration

It may still be useful to use java records because they are immutable and provide equals() plus hasCode() out of the box.

The generated pojos are not immutable, and they don't offer `equals()` or `hashCode()`.

We could add it via annotation mapping and link:{lombok}[lombok]. How this works is described in  xref:articles:mapping/object-lombok.adoc[object annotation mapping & lombok].

But we could avoid lombok for this and simply use the built-in records.

The only thing we have to do to get records is to enable it in the options section of the `mapping.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$record-mapping/mapping.yaml[]
----

<1> that is the interesting line that switches generation of pojos to records.

If `model-type` is not given the processor will generate pojos.

This is a global setting, i.e. either all schemas are generated as pojo or all schemas are generated as record.

== OpenAPI as records

After switching to records the generated `Foo.java` will look like this:

.`Foo.java` record dto
[source,java]
----
include::example$record-mapping/Foo-record.java[]
----

less code, the same properties, the same annotations, no explicit getter/setters.

Now we have to find out how well this works in real code.. :-)

== summary

This article shows how openapi-processor can generate java records instead of pojos.
